*A new way to think about rounded corners :D*

Remember when iOS 7 came out and suddenly everyone was obsessed with rounded corners? We went from sharp edges to soft, rounded edges overnight. But honestly, we’ve been doing it slightly wrong.

## The Problem with Uniform Rounding

Look at almost any modern interface right now. Cards, buttons, modals, menus; they all do the same thing: **every corner gets the same rounding**. It’s like we thought if one rounded corner is good, four identical corners must be four times better.

Here’s the problem most designers don’t notice: **uniform rounding makes everything float**.

When every corner has the same curve, nothing feels anchored. Nothing flows. Everything just sits there looking nice but kind of pointless.

## Enter Curvomorphism

I’ve been messing with a different approach, and I call it **curvomorphism**. The idea is simple:

**Only round the corners that face inward toward the center of your interface.**

Corners facing the edges of the screen? Leave them sharp.

## Why This Works

Think about how water flows around a rock. The side facing upstream stays sharp, the downstream edges get worn smooth. Curvomorphism does the same thing digitally.

Selective inner-corner rounding gives you:

* **Visual gravity**: Elements feel drawn toward the center
* **Directional flow**: Your eye follows the curves inward
* **Spatial connections**: Related elements feel more connected

## Seeing It in Action

Take a top-left navigation menu. Traditional design would round all four corners. With curvomorphism:

* **Top and left edges stay sharp** (they face the screen edges)
* **Bottom and right edges get rounded** (they face inward toward content)

Suddenly the menu flows naturally into the interface instead of just sitting on top.

## The GitHub Repository

* Want to see something concrete? Well, maybe not concrete, it's still a work in progress, but I decided to make a repository for this.

## Real-World Applications

**Dashboard Widgets**
Panels that guide attention to central content rather than floating randomly

**Modal Dialogs**
Dialogs that feel anchored instead of hovering weirdly

**Mobile Navigation**
Tab bars that grow out of the interface instead of being stuck on the bottom

**Dropdown Menus**
Menus that feel like natural extensions of buttons

## How to Do It

It’s simple. Think of border radius as directional:

```css
/* Traditional */
.card { border-radius: 8px; }

/* Curvomorphism */
.card-top-left { 
  border-bottom-right-radius: 8px; /* just the inner corner */
}
```

You can also use JavaScript to figure out which corners face inward based on each element’s position.

## Why It Matters

Curvomorphism actually:

* Cuts visual noise by clarifying hierarchy
* Guides attention
* Makes interfaces feel intentional, not just following trends

## The Bigger Picture

Curvomorphism is about **directional design thinking**. It’s not just how elements look, it’s how they relate to each other and guide users.

As screens and interfaces get more complex, we need approaches that create flow and order, not just things that look pretty.

## Try It Yourself

Next time you design something:

1. Pick the primary focal point of your screen
2. For each element, figure out which corners face inward
3. Round only those corners
4. Keep outer corners sharp

You’ll notice your interface suddenly feels more integrated.

## What’s Next

I’m still exploring this. Some possibilities:

* Animated transitions that follow the flow
* Responsive corner treatments
* Mixing with other trends like neumorphism or glassmorphism

But the principle is simple: **design with direction, not just decoration**

*P.S. Yes, I made up “curvomorphism.” Yes, I love it. But, sometimes you need a name for people to take it seriously :P *
